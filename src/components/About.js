            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>Our project will be based on the data surrounding COVID-19. 
        The pandemic has persisted around the world for a long time and has changed the lives of the many. 
        Due to how rapidly the illness can spread among others, journalism around COVID-19 seems to be never ending. 
        As we constantly deal with the news and the constant consumption of it, it can be a bit overwhelming. 
        It has also come to our attention that looking for news about COVID-19 tends to be a little bit out of place. 
        The detailed information and publications aren’t as accessible as we want. Oftentimes, news is viewed in the form of TV headlines or article headlines. 
        However, headlines aren’t descriptive and can be misunderstood/be taken with wrong intentions. 
        With this in mind, our group wants to focus on creating a platform where a variety of COVID-19 data can be easily checked. 
        Our goal from this project is to exhibit COVID-19 information in a simpler manner in hopes of more people being cautious about the pandemic.</p>

                get better in depth statistics per state such as number of cases, vaccination rate, number of deaths. We will also implement a way to visualize the data to give more meaning behind the numbers.</p>
